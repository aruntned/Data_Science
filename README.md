# Data_Science

Update1:
A simple work on using Data Science libraries.
Added jupyter/colab notebook to 
1) perform EDA on a csv file.
2) clean the master table by converting data from categorical to numerical, Y/N to binary and removing unwanted columns.
3) Create and train an XGBoost model in GPU.


Update 2:
Added python scripts to clean data and get predictions from cleaned data using a saved xgboost model in pkl format.
